description: Redesigning my portfolio for the new year. Check it out.
---
Another new year has gone. It was a crazy year for all and I am blessed that my current company has taken care of us so well.  Allowing us to work from home and develop new strategies to make the new situation work. The numbers have been a lot better and the quality of life for work balance has improved in my opinion. 

## New Goals!

Every year I try and improve and continue to be the best Front-End Dev/Designer I can be. I consider myself to have a very good blend of Front-End Dev skills and Designer skills.  This year I have improved considerably on Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe XD, and Figma skills. Applying my Design Thinking and Dev skills everyday I think I am in a great spot. With that being said, I am continuing to learn and grow and doing so I am redesigning my new portfolio. I plan to have this done by January 2021.  Here is a the mockup I have for it designed in XD!

## End Goal

My main reasoning for the redesign is that I want to show that I have improved and learned new things and am prepared to move to a new and final company.  A company that has similar style, culture, work-ethic, energy and passion. I plan on finding this company this year and having it be my final stop in my journey. I want a company where I can make a huge impact and grow with. Long term, I want to be a Sr. Dev, followed by Project Manager, and lastly a Creative Director. I can't wait!
