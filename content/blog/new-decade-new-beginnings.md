After starting my new position as a **Mid-Level Front-End Dev**, I have learned a lot about myself and where I want to be.  I left a dream job with a dream team of people who helped me get-to where I am today and I can't thank them enough.  I needed to grow and continue to reach my goal of becoming a top tier Developer so I left for a job Downtown with the big boys.  

I have learned a ton on my own by learning new tech and implementing it. This site, for one, was a huge learning curve. I learned a lot more about design, and actually designed/developed my own projects which was a first.  I feel way more comfortable with **React** and love it. I am currently working on new projects in React to showcase my skill and learn more. 

My new gig isn't exactly what I was promised aside from being a leader. The team is tiny and everyone seems to be robots. There is a huge lack of culture and it takes a toll after awhile. I now know exactly what I want in a team and company and that is having a huge **Culture**.  A team that you can learn and thrive with. Help each other out, and bounce ideas off of each other.  A company that makes it fun for their employees and makes them want to be there.  My current company lacks all of that. It is time to step out of my comfort box and start applying to all companies with great culture and help them grow with me! I am super excited to be on the hunt again and it feels great to talk to other companies with the same mindset.  I hope to land a new job very soon whether it be here in Austin where I grew up or another city.
