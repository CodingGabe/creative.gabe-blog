## Welcome to my third portfolio or Journal

This is my third journal or portfolio, as the kids call it, and this time it is built using the blazing fast, bleeding edge technology of GatsbyJS.  The new hot toy on the market. I thrive to stay up to date and speed is the name of the game. React is the industry leader in JS libraries so I am still mastery that. Gatsby is built with React so you bets believe I needed to dive in.  For more on Gatsby, check out their docs and see why I chose this as my next journal journey. Ha.  Stay tuned.
