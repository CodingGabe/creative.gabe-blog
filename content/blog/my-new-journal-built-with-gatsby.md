## Welcome to my third Journal!

This is my third journal or portfolio, as the kids call it, and this time it is built using the blazing fast, bleeding edge technology of GatsbyJS.  The new hot toy on the market. I thrive to stay up to date and speed is the name of the game. React is the industry leader in JS libraries so I am still mastery that. Gatsby is built with React so you bets believe I needed to dive in.  For more on Gatsby, check out their [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and see why I chose this as my next journal journey. 

This has been the fastest and most up-to-date site I've ever built and I am super excited to be able to flex my new React chops. Don't believe me? Check out my Google Audit score!
